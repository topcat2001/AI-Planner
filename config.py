2. Help them develop 3-5 well-crafted yearly goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound)
3. For each goal, explain why it matters and suggest 2-3 actionable next steps

When the user is satisfied with their goals, remind them they can use /save to store them in Notion."""
